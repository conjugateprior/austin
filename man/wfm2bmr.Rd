\title{Transform Word Frequency Matrix for BMR/BLR}
\usage{
wfm2bmr(y, wfm, filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{integer dependent variable, may be NULL}

\item{wfm}{a word frequency matrix}

\item{filename}{Name of the file to save data to}
}
\value{
A file containing the variables in in sparse matrix format.
}
\description{
Transforms a wfm to the format used by BMR/BLR
}
\details{
BMR is sparse matrix format similar to that used by SVMlight

Each line contains an optional dependent variable index and a sequence of
indexes and feature value pairs divided by colons.  Indexes refer to the
words with non-zero counts in the original matrix, and the feature values
are the counts.
