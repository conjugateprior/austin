\description{
  Austin helps you see what people, usually politicians, do with words.
  Currently that means how positions on a presumed underlying
  policy scale are taken by manipulating word frequency information.  
  We try to
  recover the positions using only this information and
  some heroic assumptions about language generation.
}
\details{
  Currently implemented models are Wordfish (\code{wordfish}),
  and Wordscores (\code{classic.wordscores}).
