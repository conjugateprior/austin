	Volume = {52},
	Year = {2008},
	Abstract = {Recent advances in computational methods for extracting party positions from political texts have provided scholars promising new ways for estimating party positions. However, existing methods face serious challenges when it comes to producing time-series data. This leaves a gap in the literature on estimating party ideology. We fill this gap by proposing a scaling technique to estimate positions based on word frequencies in political texts. Our technique allows researchers to locate parties in one or multiple elections. We estimate the positions of German political parties from 1990-2005 from word frequencies in party manifestos. The extracted positions reflect changes in the party system more accurately than existing time-series positions. Our method allows us to examine which words are important for placing parties on the left and the right. We find that words with strong political connotations are the best discriminators between parties. Finally, we include a series of robustness checks and demonstrate that our positions are insensitive to distributional assumptions and document selection.}}

	Year = {forthcoming},
	Abstract = {This article examines how national parties position themselves in European Parliament (EP) speeches. We apply a new computer-based content analysis technique, Wordfish, to estimate party positions in the European Parliament using the word counts in speeches. We test three hypotheses of position-taking in the European Parliament: a left-right ideology hypothesis, a pro/anti-Europe hypothesis, and a national politics hypothesis. Surprisingly, and in contrast to studies of roll call votes, we do not find evidence that national party positions from MEP speeches reflect the parties' overall left-right ideology. Instead, these positions reflect the parties' stance with regard to EU integration and national redistributive characteristics. We test the robustness of our results in a threefold manner. First, we take advantage of the multilingual environment of the European Parliament and show that the estimated positions are robust to the choice of translation (English, French, and German). Second, we use independent measures of national party positions from analyses of roll call votes and two expert surveys. Finally, we apply a range of statistical models to account for measurement error of the independent variables and the hierarchical structure of the data. Our robust findings suggest that the entire corpus of EP speeches reflects partisan divisions over EU integration rather than left-right politics.}}
