## Straight Outta R-Forge

This is a cosmetic update of the [R-forge package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/austin/) `austin` version 0.2. 

Notionally this is 0.2.2. Development on 0.2 is now stopped 
and further development will happen here.

### Installation

First ensure you have `devtools` installed.  If you don't 
```
install.packages('devtools')
```
then
```
devtools::install_github("conjugateprior/austin")
```
That's it.
