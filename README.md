# Straight Outta R-Forge

This is a cosmetic update of the R-forge package `austin`.  For real work you should currently still use the 
[old version](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/austin/).

Notionally this is version 0.2.1 but that's only to distinguish it
from the original.  Development on the old version is now stopped 
and further developments will appear here.
